Title: Longest Path in a Weighted Graph

Description:
Given a directed weighted graph, find the longest path from a source node to a destination node. The graph does not contain negative weight cycles.

Example:
Input: (Graph details)
Output: Longest path length

Input Format:
The number of nodes n and edges m, followed by m triplets representing an edge between two nodes and the weight of the edge.

Output Format:
The length of the longest path.

Constraints:
- 1 <= n, m <= 1000
- The graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

Sample Test Case 1:
Input:
5 6 1 2 5 1 3 2 2 4 7 3 5 8 4 5 1
Output:
15

Sample Test Case 2:
Input:
4 4 1 2 2 2 3 4 3 4 3 1 4 5
Output:
10
