Title: Minimum Coins for Change Problem 

Description:
Given a target sum and an infinite supply of different denominations, find the minimum number of coins needed to make the sum.

Example:
Input: sum = 11, coins = [1, 2, 5]
Output: 3 (11 = 5 + 5 + 1)

Input Format:
An integer sum, followed by an integer n (number of denominations) and n space-separated integers representing the coin denominations.

Output Format:
The minimum number of coins.

Constraints:
- 1 <= sum <= 10^4
- 1 <= n <= 100
- 1 <= coin[i] <= 10^3

Sample Test Case 1:
Input:
11 3 1 2 5
Output:
3

Sample Test Case 2:
Input:
30 4 1 3 5 10
Output:
