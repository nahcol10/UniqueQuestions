Title: Subset Sum Partition Problem

Description:
Given an array of positive integers, determine if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of the elements in both subsets is the same.

Example:
Input: [1, 5, 11, 5]
Output: True (The array can be partitioned into [1, 5, 5] and [11])

Input Format:
An integer n (length of the array) followed by n space-separated integers.

Output Format:
True or False, based on whether the partition exists.

Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 200
- 1 <= arr[i] <= 100

Sample Test Case 1:
Input:
4 1 5 11 5
Output:
True

Sample Test Case 2:
Input:
3 1 2 3
Output:
False
