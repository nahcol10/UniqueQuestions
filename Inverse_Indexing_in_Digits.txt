Title: Inverse Indexing in Digits

Description:
You are given a number that is guaranteed to have 5 digits. Each digit is unique and ranges from 1 to 5. 
Your task is to calculate the inverse of the number by switching each digit's position with its value. 
For example, if the number is 462135, then 4 is in the 1st position, 6 is in the 2nd position, etc. 
The inverse is formed by swapping each digit with the position of its value.

Example:
For the number 462135, the inverse will be 416325.
Explanation:
- 4 is at index 1 -> 1 goes to index 4
- 6 is at index 2 -> 2 goes to index 6
- And so on.

Input Format:
A single integer 'n', where 'n' is a 5-digit number consisting of the digits from 1 to 5, without missing any digit or repeating.

Output Format:
A single integer representing the inverted number.

Constraints:
- The number 'n' is a 5-digit integer consisting only of digits from 1 to 5.
- The number must not have repeating digits.

Sample Test Case 1:
Input:
462135

Output:
416325
